# znclogs1.4-to-1.6
Converts a folder full of ZNC 1.4 logs to a 1.6 directory structure

Ensure that ZNC is **not** running, place the script in the ZNC log folder, and run it with `./mergelogs.py`.

**Note**: If you're running this on a log folder generated by the *user* or *global* ZNC log modules, and your network/user names contain underscores, the script will not work correctly. Depending on your case, you will need to modify the script or rename your log files.
